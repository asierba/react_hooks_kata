# React hooks kata

This kata is intended to learn to use react hooks. Which can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

## List of contacts

I want to create an app that contains a list of contacts because I tend to forget a lot of things (like this kata).

My goals for this kata is to have an app that:

- Load my contact list dynamically based on my state
- Add a new contact to my state
- Mark a contact as favorite
- Remove contact
- Filter contacts by name

Keep in mind that you should do these features sequentially.

### Run the app
```npm run dev```

### Test the app
```jest```

### Thanks for helping me :-)
